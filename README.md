# InstaHunt

This repository contains a developing tool for OSINT on public Instagram profiles. The project aims to bypass Instagram's website restrictions, which block browser-based requests, by using GET requests directly to Instagram's API to retrieve public profile information.

The tool requires two parameters: the target user's username for sniffing and a valid CSRF token.
